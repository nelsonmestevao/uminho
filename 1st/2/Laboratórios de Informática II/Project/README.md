# Software Labs II

This is a board game which mixes tic-tac-toe with sudoku in a weird way.
Basically, you want to complete the board without make 3 X's or O's in line.

The project was to make this game in the programming language C. We had to
create a program able to generate puzzles with only one solution as well.
