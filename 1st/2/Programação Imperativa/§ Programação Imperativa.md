#### Bibliografia essencial
- The C Programming Language, Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie, Prentice
Hall Software Series (ISBN 0-13-110362-8).
- ["The C Programming Language" (sometimes referred to as K&R) is a
well-known programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie,
the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the language, as well
as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the
language was closely intertwined. The book was central to the development and
popularization of the C programming language and is still widely read and
used today. Because the book was co-authored by the original language
designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as
the de facto standard for the language, the book is regarded by many to be
the authoritative reference on C. ]
