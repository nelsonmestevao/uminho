#### Bibliografia essencial

- The C Programming Language, Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie, Prentice
    Hall Software Series (ISBN 0-13-110362-8).

> "The C Programming Language" (sometimes referred to as K&R) is a well-known
> programming book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of
> whom originally designed and implemented the language, as well as co-designed
> the Unix operating system with which development of the language was closely
> intertwined. The book was central to the development and popularization of the
> C programming language and is still widely read and used today. Because the
> book was co-authored by the original language designer, and because the first
> edition of the book served for many years as the de facto standard for the
> language, the book is regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C.
