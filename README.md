This repository contains my class notes as well as the projects I developed
during my degree. You can read all my notes [here][gitbook]. The projects are
git submodules, so you want to remember that if you clone the repository. I hope
you find it useful somehow.

## Clone

If you want to clone the repository alongside with all project just do it like
this:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:nelsonmestevao/uminho.git
```

If you forgot to use `--recurse-submodules` you can just do this:

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
